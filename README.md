# portfolio

## Description
This repository is for my personal portfoilio. As a web developer it is important to have a portfolio containing my work that I can show to employers. This portfolio is media responsive and has three different layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop. It also contains sections detailing what an employer will want to see. First is a short about me section detailing my background and what I am capable of as a web developer. This is then followed by my work which can be hovered over for a clearer view. Then lastly a list of the various ways to get in contact with me. Eventually a resume will be added when it is ready.

## Usage
1. The HTML content of the webpage can be found in the index.html file in the main folder.
2. There is one folder labeled as /assets which contains the stylesheet (located via ./assets/css/style.css) and a folder that contains the image files labled images
3. A reset file also exists in the css folder to help with opitmaztion on different browsers. It uses the same file path as the stylesheet.
4. All images used on the webpage can be accessed in the image folder (located .assets/images).
