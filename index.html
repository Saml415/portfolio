            <p>Hello my name is Sam Lloyd. I am a web developer from San Diego, California.
                I coded on and off again in the past but decided to pursue coding and 
                more specifically web development while studying Mechanical Engineering in college.
                I have had experience in similar graphic design fields such as being a member of my
                high schools yearbook team where we placed top 3 at the San Diego County Fair 
                including 1st place for our division nationally my junior year while also receiving
                personal awards for my spreads. I can code effectively in HTML, CSS and Javascript however
                like many developers Im still learning. When I am not coding my hobbies include baseball, listening
                to records and playing video games with my friends.
             </p>
